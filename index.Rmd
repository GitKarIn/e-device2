  * _output.yml: This file contains the configuration options for the output format that you're using, such as the theme, the CSS, and the JavaScript.

  * _book/: This is the directory where your compiled book is stored. It contains all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up your book.
  * 01-chapter1.Rmd, 02-chapter2.Rmd, etc.: These are the chapter files for your book, which are numbered in the order that they appear in the table of contents.
  * images/: This is the directory where you can store any images that you want to include in your book.
  * data/: This is the directory where you can store any data files that you need to use in your book.
  * e-device2/: This is the main folder of the project which contains all of the .Rmd files which compose one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.
