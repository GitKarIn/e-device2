<p>An Electronic Field Data-Entry Device (“e-Device”) Survey was distributed to IEP survey leads in July of 2022. The goals of this survey were: 1. To get an understanding of the current level of use of electronic field data entry devices among IEP Survey Staff; 2. To seek information from expert e-device users about both hardware and software considerations, and 3. To the learn specific roadblocks for those who are hesitant to consider shifting to electronic data entry methods.</p>
<p>Three groups were targeted for this survey:<br>
1. Experienced e-device users (internal IEP and external agencies),<br>
2. IEP Survey Staff who are researching e-devices for field application,<br>
3. IEP Survey Staff who don’t believe electronic field data collection will work for their application.</p>

<p>The IEP e-device survey was run for approximately a month and received 24 responses (Figure <a href="cross.html#fig:survey">3.1</a>. A link to the original survey and to the compiled survey responses is included in the Appendix 2.</p>

<p>Among the 24 respondents, half of these were IEP associates and external contacts that are already using e-device applications for their survey data collections. Five (20%) of the respondents were IEP associates who were currently seeking e-device solutions for their survey data collections. Two of the respondents indicated that they have already determined that electronic data entry would not work for their IEP survey application, and 5 respondents did not answer the question about their e-device use experience/status. An experienced e-device user resource list has been initiated, including contact names, software type, and type of survey application; this list will be expanded as possible (Appendix ).</p>
